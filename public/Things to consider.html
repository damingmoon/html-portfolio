<h2>Things to Consider Before Building a Portfolio</h2>
<p>Risk-taking capacity: Risk tolerance shows the level of risk the investor is willing to take. It is the basis through which you
     choose the type of portfolio. For example, investors with a high-risk appetite may choose an aggressive portfolio by investing in high-risk stocks or mutual funds. However, the risk-averse portfolio may choose a conservative portfolio. You must invest as per the level of risk you are willing to take.</p>

        <li><h3>Financial Goals:</h3><p>One of the other determining factors for building a portfolio is your financial goals, which you want to accomplish. For example, if you are investing for your non-negotiable goal, like your child’s higher education, investing in very high-risk avenues may not be prudent.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Diversification:</h3><p>As an old and well-known saying goes, ‘Never put all your eggs in one basket,’ diversification is a tool that is used to reduce the risk in the portfolio by allocating your funds to different asset classes. Your portfolio should not be concentrated on one asset class but diversified 
            among multiple asset classes. Diversifying your portfolio will cushion your investments from market shocks.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Investment Horizon:</h3><p>The investment horizon is the time an investor has to achieve a particular goal. It significantly impacts risk tolerance, asset allocation, diversification, portfolio rebalancing, and tax implication. Generally, an investor with a longer time horizon is comfortable with investing in equities.
             However, equities are not recommended for investors having a short investment horizon.</p>
            <p>Usually, long-term investors can afford to take on more risk and may opt for a more aggressive portfolio.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, they will benefit from a more aggressive asset allocation, greater diversification, and less frequent portfolio rebalancing.</p>
    <p>Conversely, investors with short-term horizons or nearing retirement should stick to a less risky investment and may opt conservative portfolio.</p></li>
