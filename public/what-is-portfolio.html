     <h2>What is Portfolio?</h2>
     <p>The meaning of a portfolio may vary depending on the investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation of a person.</p>
     <p>A portfolio includes different financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, bank fixed deposits, etc., that investors hold for a particular period.  Having these multiple assets in the portfolio helps you to mitigate the risk involved in the specific investments and 
        helps in generating maximum return over the period. A well-structured portfolio allows investors to diversify their investments, match risk with the risk appetite of the investor, and achieve financial goals in time.</p>
