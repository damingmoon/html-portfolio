<h2>Types of Portfolios</h2>
<p>You can create various types of investment portfolios to fulfill your goals. Your investment portfolio 
    should be in sync with your risk appetite. Some of the most common types of portfolios are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><h3> Aggressive Portfolio:</h3><p>An aggressive portfolio aims to maximise returns while taking a relatively high degree of risk. 
            This portfolio suits investors with high-risk tolerance capacities, like young investors or those with time to achieve a particular goal.</p></li>
        <li><h3>. Conservative Portfolio:</h3><p>This portfolio is designed for low-risk tolerance investors, such as those with short-term goals. A conservative portfolio
             will have a high allocation to low-risk fixed-income instruments and traditional investments. A conservative portfolio may have a small smattering of high-quality stocks. It is also known as a defensive portfolio.</p></li>
        <li><h3> Income Portfolio:</h3><p>This portfolio is focused on regular income from investments. It includes investments in bonds, debt securities, as well as stocks which regularly pay dividends. This type of portfolio is suitable
             for a risk-averse investor who does not want to take any risk. Retirees who want regular income during their golden years may also prefer this portfolio.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Speculative Portfolio:</h3><p>This portfolio is considered as most risky among all portfolio types. As in this portfolio, investments are made in risky instruments with the expectation of substantial gains in the future.</p>
        <p>This may include betting on Initial Public Offerings (IPO) or stocks with growth potential, buying low-rated bonds or debentures for higher returns, or investing in options or futures contracts as a form of portfolio protection.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Hybrid Portfolio:</h3><p>This portfolio primarily allocates your investments between two types of assets: equity and debt. While equities have the potential to produce high returns and build wealth, they also come with higher risks due to short-term volatility.</p>
        <p>Conversely, debt includes interest-bearing securities that provide steady income and is generally considered a lower-risk asset class than equity. By blending equity and debt, which have a low correlation, the hybrid portfolio can reduce portfolio risk effectively.</p></li>
