<h2>Components of a Portfolio</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h3>Stocks:</h3><p> A type of security that gives you a share of ownership in a company. These are considered highly risky investments due to their volatility.
         Due to the higher underlying risk in equities, they have a great potential to deliver high returns.</p>
        <p>Stocks can be further classified into large cap, mid cap, and small caps based on their market capitalisation. Sebi defines large-cap stocks as the top 100 companies as per market 
            capitalisation, Mid-cap stocks include companies with a rank between 101-250, and Small-cap stocks include companies starting from rank 251 onwards based on market cap.</p></li>
         <li><h3>Bonds:</h3><p>These instruments are used by the government or companies to raise money by borrowing from investors. These debt instruments offer you a regular rate of return through coupon payments. You also receive 
            your investment amount or face value at maturity.  These are considered less risky investments than stocks. They often offer lower returns on your investments than equities.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Mutual Funds:</h3><p> Mutual funds are an investment vehicle in which multiple investors pool their money to achieve a common objective. The fund manager then invests this pooled money across various asset classes such as
                 equity, debt, gold, and other securities to generate returns. The fund manager makes the investment as per the investment objective of that particular mutual fund. The gains and losses from such investments are distributed to investors in proportion to their shares.</p></li>
                 <li><h3>Gold:</h3><p>It is one of the oldest and most-loved forms of investment. The yellow metal is widely recognised and valued worldwide and is regarded as a safe-haven asset due to its propensity to increase in value during economic uncertainty or market volatility. 
                    You can invest in gold through various modesâ€“ physical gold in the form of jewelry, bars or coins; paper gold- via gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or government-backed Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs); or in digital gold.</p></li>
                 <li><h3>Real Estate</h3><p>It includes investments in real estate properties such as residential houses, commercial shops, villas, etc. In this investment, you earn income through rentals and capital appreciation. You can invest in real estate by investing physically 
                    and through real estate investment trusts (REITs). Some new-age companies also allow you fractional ownership of real estate properties. They offer you regular interest income as well as capital appreciation.</p></li>
<h4><p>Each investment option holds some degree of risk. The investor needs to be mindful of the risk profile of his investments to suit his risk tolerance. A conservative investor may not be comfortable with investing in risky asset classes. Similarly, an aggressive investor who is willing 
    to take higher risks to earn high returns on his or her portfolio may not be happy with investing in conservative investments, which offer lower returns.</p></h4>
